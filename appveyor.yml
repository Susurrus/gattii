# Appveyor configuration template for Rust using rustup for Rust installation
# https://github.com/starkat99/appveyor-rust

## Operating System (VM environment) ##

# Rust needs at least Visual Studio 2013 Appveyor OS for MSVC targets.
os: Visual Studio 2015

## Build Matrix ##

# This configuration will setup a build for each channel & target combination (12 windows
# combinations in all).
#
# There are 3 channels: stable, beta, and nightly.
#
# Alternatively, the full version may be specified for the channel to build using that specific
# version (e.g. channel: 1.5.0)
#
# The values for target are the set of windows Rust build targets. Each value is of the form
#
# ARCH-pc-windows-TOOLCHAIN
#
# Where ARCH is the target architecture, either x86_64 or i686, and TOOLCHAIN is the linker
# toolchain to use, either msvc or gnu. See https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html#win-foot for
# a description of the toolchain differences.
# See https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/#toolchain-specification for description of
# toolchains and host triples.
#
# Comment out channel/target combos you do not wish to build in CI.
#
# You may use the `cargoflags` and `RUSTFLAGS` variables to set additional flags for cargo commands
# and rustc, respectively. For instance, you can uncomment the cargoflags lines in the nightly
# channels to enable unstable features when building for nightly. Or you could add additional
# matrix entries to test different combinations of features.

  matrix:

### MSVC Toolchains ###

# The MSVC toolchain is not supported for this program right now

### GNU Toolchains ###

  # Stable 64-bit GNU
    - channel: stable
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
      BITS: 64
  # Stable 32-bit GNU
    - channel: stable
      target: i686-pc-windows-gnu
      BITS: 32
  # Nightly 64-bit GNU
    - channel: nightly
      target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
      BITS: 64
      #cargoflags: --features "unstable"
  # Nightly 32-bit GNU
    - channel: nightly
      target: i686-pc-windows-gnu
      BITS: 32
      #cargoflags: --features "unstable"

### Allowed failures ###

# See Appveyor documentation for specific details. In short, place any channel or targets you wish
# to allow build failures on (usually nightly at least is a wise choice). This will prevent a build
# or test failure in the matching channels/targets from failing the entire build.

## Install Script ##

# This is the most important part of the Appveyor configuration. This installs the version of Rust
# specified by the 'channel' and 'target' environment variables from the build matrix. This uses
# rustup to install Rust.
#
# For simple configurations, instead of using the build matrix, you can simply set the
# default-toolchain and default-host manually here.
install:
  - IF "%BITS%" == "32" SET ARCH=i686
  - IF "%BITS%" == "64" SET ARCH=x86_64
  - appveyor DownloadFile https://win.rustup.rs/ -FileName rustup-init.exe
  - rustup-init -yv --default-toolchain %channel% --default-host %target%
  - set PATH=C:\msys64\mingw%BITS%\bin;C:\msys64\usr\bin;%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin;%PATH%
  - rustc -vV
  - cargo -vV
  - pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-%ARCH%-gtk3 mingw-w64-%ARCH%-adwaita-icon-theme

## Build Script ##

# Build the project
build_script:
  - cargo build

# There are no tests, so don't bother running a test stage
test: false

# Package after building is successful. We use 7zip in an after_build section
# instead of in artifacts because artifacts doesn't allow for manipulating
# the resultant directory path in the archive
after_build:
  - mkdir -p share/icons
  - cp -r /mingw64/share/icons/Adwaita share/icons
  - mkdir -p share/glib-2.0/schemas
  - cp /mingw64/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser.gschema.xml share/glib-2.0/schemas
  - glib-compile-schemas share/glib-2.0/schemas
  - 7z a gattii.zip share
  - 7z a gattii.zip `ldd target/debug/gattii.exe | grep mingw64 | cut -d" " -f3`
  - 7z a gattii.zip %APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER%/target/debug/gattii.exe
